:Manual section: 3

SYNOPSIS
========

tam [option] <symbol-cache.sym> <pre-processed-source-code.pp> <struct-header.h>

DESCRIPTION
===========

TAM stands for Tarsio Auto Mocker

tam generate a source file to stdout, on the format of a pre-processed C file.
This source file contain the exact same thing as the pre-processed input file,
except all function calls have been replaced with calls to __tarsio_proxy*
equivalents, generated by tmg(3).

OPTIONS
=======

tam only take three input files paths as arguments.

The symbol cache input file should be generated with tcg(3).

--help, -h     Show help text
--version, -v  Print the version of tam

EXAMPLES
========

If this would be the design under check::

  static void other_func(int a) {
    :
    Do something
    :
  }

  static void my_func(int a) {
    :
    Do something
    :
    other_func(a + 1);
  }

The symbols and symbol usage detected by tcg(3) would enable tmg to generate
the something like following code::

  void other_func(int a) {
    :
    Do something
    :
  }

  extern void __tarsio_proxy_other_func(int a);

  void my_func(int a) {
    :
    Do something
    :
    __tarsio_proxy_other_func(a + 1);
  }

This is however quite hidden in the build chains. The use for this code is
that every time a function is called in your design under check each function
will be controllable through the proxy function and the ``tarsio_mock``
variable.
