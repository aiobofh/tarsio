Install from source
-------------------

To install Tarsio on your system you need a C compiler capable of compiling
at least ANSI C or ISO C90. Maybe even earlier standards could do the trick.

The Tarsio tools are coded with care for portability - And there are very
few dependencies. So there should not be need for any 3rd party libraries or
tools to build the software.

GNU Make and GCC on Linux/Unix/BSD or similar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest release from https://www.aio.nu/tarsio.html

The normal way of building and installing Tarsio from the tar-ball::

$ tar xzf tarsio-*.tar.gz
$ cd tarsio-*
$ make
$ sudo make install

If you do not want to install in /usr/ as prefix path just pass the PREFIX
variable to the ``make install`` command::

$ make install PREFIX=$HOME

This will install a header-file and .mk-file in the <PREFIX>/include/tarsio
folder, and the binary tools in <PREFIX>/bin.

Smake and SAS/C on AmigaOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest release from https://www.aio.nu/tarsio.html

Unpacking source archive and compile::

> lha x tarsio-#?-src.lha
> cd tarsio-#?
> smake

If you want to compile optimizations for a specific CPU you can set the CPU
environment variable. Example: 68000, 68020, 68030, 68040 or 68060

You can either install using smake or the Commodore Installer or equivalent::

> assign TARSIO: <some path>
> smake install
> path ADD TARSIO:C

Note: If you install like this it's recommended to add the assign and path
      to your S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence.

or::

> installer Install-Tarsio

This will install a header-file and .smk-file in the TARSIO:include/tarsio
folder, and the binary tools in TARSIO:C

GNU Make and VBCC on AmigaOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest release from https://www.aio.nu/tarsio.html

Unpacking source archive and compile::

> lha x tarsio-#?-src.lha
> cd tarsio-#?
> make

If you want to compile optimizations for a specific CPU you can set the CPU
environment variable. Example: 68000, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060, PowerUP
or WarpOS.

There is also an OS flag for compiling for AmigaOS classic or AmigaOS4 or
MorphOS.

You can either install using smake or the Commodore Installer or equivalent::

> assign TARSIO: <some path>
> make install
> path ADD TARSIO:C

Note: If you install like this it's recommended to add the assign and path
      to your S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence.

or::

> installer Install-Tarsio

This will install a header-file and .smk-file in the TARSIO:include/tarsio
folder, and the binary tools in TARSIO:C
