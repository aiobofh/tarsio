* TODO 00 2020-02-17 Improve line and branch coverage in refactoring :tarsio:

  As a software developer I want Tarsio to have better code coverage to ensure
  quality, and provide good examples on how to write Tarsio-ch
* TODO 00 2020-02-17 Remove as much "test" in benefit of "check"     :tarsio:

  As the author of Tarsio I want better consistency of the usage of the words
  testing and checking to be less confusing.

* TODO 00 2020-02-18 Make Travis CI work for developing Tarsio       :tarsio:

  As a maintainer of Tarsio I would like continuous integration when commits
  are pushed to the repository, to make it easier to find errors and flaws in
  the code base.
