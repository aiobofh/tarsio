The Tariso project is licenced under LGPL, this means Open Source. So
contributions as very welcome! Let's have fun together!

Also, posting issues in Github is extremely helpful.

If you want to make minor changes, make sure all regression tests pass
and that you are coding with "good taste". Tarsio will never be perfect
but let's try to strive for it, together. To run regressino tests just
run the self-checks from the root-folder of the project.

 $ make check

If you plan to make a bigger change, please branch and make pull-requests
that are easy to understand.

At the time of writing there is no automated regression testing in Github,
but the plan is to make it so.
